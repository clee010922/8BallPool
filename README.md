# Development Log
5/20/19: 
Chong: Started the project. Made a Table class that will have all components of the game. Added instance variables and few methods.
Brandon: Wrote some of the basics for some of the classes starting with Table. Created about 3 arrays to keep track of everything in Table and mostly organized all the classes with nothing to display at this point.

5/21/19: 
Chong: created an Experiment folder to play with the shooting and the collisions of the balls.
Brandon: Worked on the table of the pool game and drew some of the balls and pockets to be added into their corresponding arrays.

5/22/19: 
Chong: kept working on the experiment class and the dragging/shooting of the ball. In class, the dragging worked but the ball was moving in a wrong direction. Also, the shapes were leaving traces when they were moving. Looking to fix that. At home, Chong fixed the dragging/shooting of the ball. The ball moves correctly and according to how long the mouse drag was, the ball moves at different speeds.
Brandon: Got all of the balls on the table and in the correct positions. Added a number to each ball and a stripe to those that need a stripe. Worked on placing a rectangle wall between pockets.

5/23/19: 
Chong: continued to work on the experiment folder and successfully changed every code regarding movement and location with PVector, which will make our lives easier when calculating collisions. 
Brandon: continued working on placing the walls and placing the walls at a diagonal that connects with the holes. All the walls are finished for easy x and y detection but might adjust placements later to make it look better.
